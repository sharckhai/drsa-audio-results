  <h1>Disentangled Explanations for Neural Network Predictions on Audio Data</h1>
  <p class="description">
    This page depicts results of the experiments conducted within the scope of my master's thesis. The goal was to extract concept-based explanations
    on neural networks trained on audio classification tasks. Relevant concepts were optimized with Disentangled Relevant Subspace Analysis (DRSA). 
    Relevances were attributed with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Two experiments have been conducted which include audio classification of synthetic data, and music 
    genre recognition on the GTZAN dataset. For both tasks a Convolutional Neural Network was employed, to classify log-mel-spectrograms. 
    The extracted explanations were transformed into listenable audios, and are provided on this page.
    References, further information and images, as well as a link to the GitHub repo will follow.
