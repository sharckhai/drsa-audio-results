      This page depicts the results of the experiments conducted within the scope of my master's thesis which I completed at the Machine Learning Group
      TU Berlin under the supervision of K. R. Müller and Grégoire Montavon. The abstract and a brief overview of the research process are provided 
      in the following. For a comprehensive overview of the methodologies implemented in this work, please refer to the report. Code and report are linked

          the relevance flow disentangled after filtering it through the subspaces, distinct explanation components can be visualized at the inputs.</figcaption>

    <p>
      As nonlinear Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly used in various real world applications, their black-box nature hinders in-depth model 
      evaluation, apart from performance measures. In response, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has made much progress. It aims 
      to reveal the rationale behind complex ML models, often by assigning relevance scores to model parts and input features, e.g., pixels. However, in 
      some domains such as audio processing, where data—like time or time-frequency representations of amplitudes—is of rather unintuitive nature, the 
      extracted explanations can be hard to grasp for humans. Suitably, a novel sub-field in the realm of XAI has emerged in very recent time that aims to 
      decompose explanations into multiple sub-explanations, representing distinct decision concepts. These approaches offer a promising foundation to gain 
      more valuable insights into models and the data domain, especially when dealing with complex data scenarios. This study targets the extraction of 
      concept-based explanations for a neural network applied to audio classification tasks, by utilizing the newly proposed method, Disentangled Relevant 
      Subspace Analysis (DRSA), in combination with Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP).

      <h2 >Brief Summary of Research Methodology and Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Conceptualization and training of a Deep Learning (DL) approach to solve audio classification tasks on inputs in time-frequency domain. 
          The tasks are solved with a Convolutional Neural Network. The main showcase is conducted on a Music Genre Recognition (MGR) task 
          on the GTZAN dataset <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explanation of model decisions on a local basis by utilizing the backpropagation-based XAI method 
          LRP <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subsequently, relevant subspaces are optimized in latent space of the network with the newly proposed concept-based XAI method 
          DRSA <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. 
          By implementing a two-step attribution that allows to condition relevances on single subspaces while propagating those from
          the outputs to the inputs, concept-based explanations can be visualized in the input domain. This process is schematically 
          depicted in the figure below.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design of a methodology to transform explanations in time-frequency space into listenable audios to maximize human interpretability of those.
        </li>
        <li>
          Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the extracted disentangled explanations to demonstrate the advantage of concept-based explanations 
          and the enhanced explanatory value obtained through the application of DRSA. To provide a solid basis for evaluation, a synthetic dataset is 
          created that fits the purpose of this study.
