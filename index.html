  <h1>Disentangled Explanations for Neural Network Predictions on Audio Data</h1>
  <p class="description">
    The focus of this work was to extract disentangled explanations with Disentangled Relevant Subspace Analysis (DRSA)
    that define the descicion behaviour of neural networks trained on audio data. This page represents the results, i.e. extracted explanations, in form of listenable audio tracks. Results are provided for synthetically generated audio signals, as well as a showcase on real music data. 
    A convolutional neural network was trained to solve the audio classification tasks. References, further information and images, as well as a link to the GitHub repo will follow.
