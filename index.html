  <h1>Disentangled Explanations for Neural Network Predictions on Audio Data</h1>
  <p class="description">
    Below are links to various groups of audio collections generated within the scope of my master's thesis. Main focus was to extract disentangled explanations 
    that define the descicion behaviour of neural networks trained on synthetically generated audio signals, as well as a showcase on real music data. For the latter showcase 
    a convolutional neural network was trained to classify samples contained in the GTZAN dataset into 10 genres.
