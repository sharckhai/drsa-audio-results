# DRSA Audio Results

This webpage presents the results and visualizations from the master's thesis **"Explainable Audio AI: Disentangled Neural Network Explanations"** by Samuel Harck.

**Live Demo:** [https://sharckhai.github.io/drsa-audio-results/](https://sharckhai.github.io/drsa-audio-results/)

## About

This interactive website showcases disentangled explanations for audio classification using DRSA (Disentangled Relevant Subspace Analysis) and LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation). The site includes:

- Music genre classification results on the GTZAN dataset
- Concept-based explanations for Classical, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Metal, and Reggae
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of DRSA
- Synthetic toy case demonstrations
- Interactive audio players with waveform visualizations

## Original Research
