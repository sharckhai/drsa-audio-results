      This page depicts the results on a special case to qualitatively evaluate DRSA, and show that concepts extracted with DRSA are indeed class specific. 
      This assumption is also quantitatively proven in the report in Chapter 4.2.3. 
      In this experiment, the explanations for jazz samples were disentangled with the subspaces extracted for hiphop music. As an example: subspace 2 
      of hiphop music represents the kick drum, i.e., low frequencies. As we can see in the figure below, this subspace fails to accurately extract the 
      low frequencies of jazz music which indicates, that subspaces react to not only frequency bands but to higher-level dynamics (rhythmic structures) 
      of sound concepts. When inspecting this special case it is recommended to also examine the "real" explanations of both genres jazz and hiphop.

      <br><br>

      Shown are snippets of two different samples of jazz music, whose explanations were propagated through hiphop subspaces. The standard heatmap specifies 
      the local explanation as obtained with standard LRP. The subspace heatmaps represent the disentangled explanation-components as extracted with DRSA and 
      LRP. In order to enable good visual inspection, the icons to play the associated audios are provided beneath the figures in the same exact order as the 
      images in the figure.
